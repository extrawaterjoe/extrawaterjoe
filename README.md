### Hi, everyone! I’m Joe

I’m a software engineer focused on building applications for businesses, entreprenuers, and independent creators. I enjoy collaborating with design and product teams to develop outstanding user experiences using modern frameworks. Over the last year, I had the privilege of working at [Zora](https://zora.co/), where I played a key role in building [Nouns Builder](https://github.com/ourzora/nouns-builder) as well as contributing to various other web3 start-ups. In addition to my professional work, I offer freelance services encompassing website design and development, digital marketing solutions, SEO, and online brand strategies.
